## Contract Details

In this repo I have created a Solidity smart contract bult on remix.ethereum.orgthat accepts two user addresses that will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Contract In Action

Below you will find the step by step process of the smart contract transacting between the two accounts.
